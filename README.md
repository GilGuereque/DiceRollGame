## This is a simple console application to simulate a Dice rolling game.
### The objective of this game is for the user to guess the correct number (1 - 6) of the dice roll.
### If the user guesses wrong a total of 3 times, then the game is over. If the user guesses right within those 3 tries, the user wins the game.
